# Summer Playlist 
## Mac Demarco
<p>The music artist I listened to the most this summer was MacDemarco. The reason why I listen to the songs he makes because most of his songs have a soothing feeling when you listen to them. Whenever I needed to rest or chill, I play one of his songs.</p>

## Tyler, The Creator
<p>Tylers music is a great listen and I highly recommened it to anyone</p>

# Tennis
<p>During the break, about once a week I would play tennis with a freind or two. While playing tennis we would warm up before we play and then get into playing a game. We wouldnt have enough time for a full match so we would always end up just playing one set.</p>
