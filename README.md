# Summer Playlist 
## Mac Demarco
<p>The music artist I listened to the most this summer was MacDemarco. I listen to the songs he makes because most of his songs have a soothing feeling when you listen to them. Whenever I needed to rest or chill, I played one of his songs.</p>

## Tyler, The Creator
<p> Tyler's music is a great listen and I highly recommend it to anyone</p>

# Tennis
<p>During the break, I would play tennis with a friend or two about once a week. While playing tennis we would warm up before we play and then get into playing a game. We wouldn't have enough time for a full match so we would always end up just playing one set. While playing I would have to bring a hat and towel due to the heat. </p>

# Expectations for this Class/Goals for the School Year
<p>My main goal for this class is to be able to pass the upcoming AP test in May. A side goal I have is to be able to pass this class with an A and get the credit to boost my GPA. Another goal that I have is to be able to learn how to code using Javascript and make a program with it. I also want to use the experience in this class to potentially help with getting a job in the future. </p>
